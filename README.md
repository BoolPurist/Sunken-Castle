## Purpose

It is  2D game made in Unity. As a top down game in the gerne rogue-like.
Currently you play a character which goes from one level to the other. In every level you have to kill all enemies.

## How To Play it

Caution: We only tested the game on windows 10. So it is not certain if it works on another os.

Currently the executable can not be downloaded directly. You have to build yourself. To do that, clone the respo on your computer.

Start the project with the version "2019.3.13f1" by selecting the folder "Rogue-Game-2D-Unity-Project" in unity hub. Go to the file/Build Settings and make sure "PC, Max & Linux Standalone is selected".
Then select file/build and run and select the folder where the executable game should be stored. Then in that folder you should find the executable you can double click to start the game. The executable should have the name of the unity project.
